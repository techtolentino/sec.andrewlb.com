Hey, great to meet everyone.

I'm Andrew Lovett-Barron, Canadian/American currently living in Copenhagen. I studied political science at the University of Toronto, but have been working as a product designer and software developer for the past decade, including at IDEO (a global design firm) and the US Department of Defense as part of the Defense Digital Service. After that, I was a Public Interest Technology fellow at New America exploring social enterprise, which is partially responsible for my being in Denmark. I currently run my own software products and consult around Europe.

I'm interested in a lot of things, though in the context of this program I'm particularly curious to explore middle east issues, topics around CVE, and public/private partnership in the defense/intel space. (And frankly a ton of other things, but those come to mind immediately)

I also have a new son named Emil who's almost 5 months old. As you can imagine, he has been taking the bulk of my time, so that part has been a big and wonderful focus this summer.

Anyway, excited for the next two years and hope to meet most of you at the study school later this month.
